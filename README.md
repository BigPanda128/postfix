Postfix converter application
2/10/15

Application was supposed to convert from postfix to infix notation then solve. I did not get it to convert from one notation to the other. I was referencing algorithms online and other people code that follows a similar fashion to get where i am. The code code was in easy terms for me to understand everything easily, however when it did not work i went through and tried to make it identical to the code i was referenceing and that is what is currently in there now. It still does not conver from one format to the other from what i can tell. It is very fustrating. I will be coming back to this before the exam for sure.
